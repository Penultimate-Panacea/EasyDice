# EasyDice
Python Package for Easy, Seeded Dice

## Goals
1. To have a library of functions that allows the user to roll dice for use in code
2. To have a repeatable set of unique dice, such that, each instance of the particular dice will produce the same results in the same order each time
3. To have the library handle exceptions and exit gracefully when possible
4. To have full test and documentation coverage of the library
5. To create a web page for the library
